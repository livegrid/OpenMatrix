# LiveGrid UI

SvelteJS based UI for LiveGrid. Use the following functions:

## Install Dependencies

UI source code requires dependencies to be installed for development & compiling.

```sh
npm i -S
```

## Run Development Server

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Build UI

For reflecting changes which you have done in the source code, you will have to compile the UI. Compiling the UI will automatically update the source code in your C++ library.

```sh
npm run build
```
